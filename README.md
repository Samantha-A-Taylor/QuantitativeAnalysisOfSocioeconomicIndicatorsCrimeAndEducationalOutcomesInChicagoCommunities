## Project Overview ☰

This project analyzes Chicago community-level datasets, including census socioeconomic indicators, public school performance, and reported crime incidents. It aims to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations across social, educational, and safety metrics to inform data-driven insights for policymakers, educators, and analysts.

## Key Takeaways 🔎

       ✓ Integrated census, school, and crime datasets for community-level analysis  
       ✓ Revealed strong correlations between hardship index and crime concentration  
       ✓ Identified weak-to-moderate links between socioeconomic factors and student attendance  
       ✓ Preserved and handled missing data to maintain analytical integrity  
       ✓ Visualized spatial and temporal trends, highlighting disparities across Chicago communities  
       ✓ Extracted actionable insights to inform policymakers, educators, and urban planners  

## Key Features 🔑

* **Project Framing & Analytical Design:**

       ✓ Defined quantitative research question linking socioeconomic indicators, crime, and education across Chicago communities  
       ✓ Identified key variables: income, unemployment, crime rates, graduation rates  
       ✓ Designed cross-sectional, community-level analysis framework  
       ✓ Formulated hypotheses on socioeconomic disadvantage, crime, and school attendance  

* **Data Acquisition & Integration:**

       ✓ Collected public datasets: Census, CPS Progress Reports, Chicago Crimes (2001–Present)  
       ✓ Aggregated data at community level, joining via community area identifiers  
       ✓ Assessed dataset compatibility and coverage for merged analysis  

* **Data Cleaning & Preparation:**

       ✓ Inspected for missing values, inconsistencies, outliers, and anomalies  
       ✓ Standardized and transformed variables for analysis (rates, percentages, numeric fields) 
       ✓ Handled incomplete records and ensured post-merge data integrity  

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

       ✓ Computed descriptive statistics and community-level distributions  
       ✓ Compared socioeconomic, crime, and educational metrics across communities  
       ✓ Identified initial patterns and trends linking hardship, crime, and attendance  

* **Statistical Analysis:**

       ✓ Conducted correlation analysis: socioeconomic indicators ↔ crime ↔ education  
       ✓ Applied regression to assess predictive relationships  
       ✓ Evaluated statistical significance and interpreted coefficients in real-world context  
       ✓ Highlighted correlation vs. causation limitations  

* **Data Visualization:**

       ✓ Created scatterplots, summary tables, bar charts, and spatial plots to illustrate relationships 
       ✓ Generated correlation heatmaps of census indicators and regression-line scatterplots for hardship vs crime and school
          attendance  
       ✓ Used strip plots to highlight top/bottom communities per indicator  
       ✓ Visualized school counts and average attendance per level  
       ✓ Mapped crime hotspots and community clustering to highlight disparities  
       ✓ Designed visuals for clarity, comparison, storytelling, and analytical insight  

* **Interpretation & Insight Generation:**

       ✓ Converted statistical results into actionable insights  
       ✓ Identified structural patterns of disadvantage, crime exposure, and education outcomes  
       ✓ Contextualized findings within urban inequality and public policy  
       ✓ Synthesized results into coherent community-level narratives  

* **Reporting & Documentation:**

       ✓ Authored structured Jupyter Notebook report with text, tables, and visualizations  
       ✓ Documented data sources, methodology, analytical approach, and key findings  
       ✓ Ensured reproducibility, transparency, and academic-style organization  
       ✓ Addressed assumptions, limitations, and design constraints  

* **Critical Evaluation & Limitations:**

       ✓ Recognized observational data constraints, reporting bias, and cross-sectional limits  
       ✓ Acknowledged potential confounders (school resources, policing, etc.)  
       ✓ Recommended future analyses: longitudinal studies and expanded education metrics  

## Technologies Used 

       ✓ Python  
       ✓ Pandas  
       ✓ Matplotlib  
       ✓ Seaborn  
       ✓ SQLite3  
       ✓ Jupyter Notebook
