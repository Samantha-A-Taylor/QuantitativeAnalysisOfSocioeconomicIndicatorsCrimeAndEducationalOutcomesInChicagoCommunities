## Project Overview ☰

This project analyzes Chicago community-level datasets, including census socioeconomic indicators, public school performance, and reported crime incidents. It aims to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations across social, educational, and safety metrics to inform data-driven insights for policymakers, educators, and analysts.

## Key Takeaways 🔎

       ✓ Merged census, school, and crime datasets to enable community-level comparisons  
       ✓ Identified correlations between hardship index and crime counts, highlighting areas for further study  
       ✓ Found weak but notable relationships between socioeconomic factors and student attendance  
       ✓ Preserved meaningful missing data to maintain analytical accuracy  
       ✓ Visualized spatial and temporal trends in crime and educational outcomes across Chicago  

## Key Features 🔑

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

       ✓ Summarize census indicators, school metrics, and crime statistics individually  
       ✓ Identify top and bottom communities for key socioeconomic indicators  
       ✓ Visualize distributions and correlations using strip plots, heatmaps, and summary tables  
       ✓ Examine temporal trends in crime and attendance  
       ✓ Detect spatial clustering of incidents and community-level patterns  

* **Integrated Analysis:**

       ✓ Merge datasets to create a unified view per community  
       ✓ Explore relationships between socioeconomic hardship, per capita income, crime rates, and school attendance  
       ✓ Conduct hypothesis testing using correlation analysis  
       ✓ Highlight communities with higher risk or lower educational engagement for further investigation  

## Visualizations 📶

       ✓ Correlation heatmaps of census indicators  
       ✓ Scatterplots with regression lines for hardship vs crime and school attendance  
       ✓ Strip plots of top/bottom communities per indicator  
       ✓ Bar charts of school counts and average attendance per level  
       ✓ Spatial plots of crime hotspots and community clustering  

## Technologies Used 🛠️

       ✓ Python  
       ✓ Pandas  
       ✓ Matplotlib  
       ✓ Seaborn  
       ✓ SQLite3  
       ✓ Jupyter Notebook
